 ## My first code review on everything we learned this week.
    This app should have 3 sections "About me" "projects" and "backgrounds" 
    under projects each project has a direct link to the project.
  ### Known Bugs
    The only "bug" I have was figuring out github.
     Cant seem to resize the projects section
  #### Technologies Used
    HTML and CSS
  ##### Link to git hub page
