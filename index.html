        <p id="box">In the past I have been a restaurant manager, a bar manager, and a bartender. Im 37 years old and
            have been
            in hospitality for 19 years up until I joined this program. I have enjoyed the team aspect of the food
            service industry and meeting new people but I am ready for something more <span class="highlight">
                challenging</span>. I have lived in 3 cities and on one "island", KeyWest was my favorite place to live.</p>

        <p id="box">I enjoy traveling the world with my husband, learning about other cultures and petting dogs. I
            always
            <em>think</em> I enjoy hiking and nature but as it turns out I just like to be able to see it from a nice
            patio with cup of coffee. My main hobbies are going to comedy shows, cooking, running and forcing myself to
            go to the gym. While managing restaurants and bars I learned to streamline the point of sales system for maximum efficiency and increased sales. I have recently finished a beginner course in python, and Excel to add to my list of skills
            which include but are
            <strong>not</strong> limited to communication, training, scheduling, customer service, and attention to detail.
