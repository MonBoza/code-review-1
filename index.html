        <p>In the past I have been a restaurant manager, a bar manager, and a bartender. Im 37 years old and have been in hospitality for 19 years up until I joined this program. I have enjoyed the team aspect of the food service industry and meeting new people but I am ready for
            something more challenging.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I enjoy traveling the world with my husband, learning about other cultures and petting dogs.I always think I enjoy hiking and nature but as it turns out I just like to be able to see it from a nice patio with cup of coffee. My main hobbies are going to comedy shows, cooking, running and forcing myself to go to the gym.</p>
        <p>I have recently finished a beginner course in python, and Excel to add to my list of skills which include but not limited to communication, training, scheduling, customer service, and attention to detail.</p>
